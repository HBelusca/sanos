Sanos Operating System Kernel
-----------------------------

Sanos is an OS kernel for use in PC based server appliances. The kernel
was developed as part of an experiment on investigating the feasibility
of running java server applications without a traditional operating 
system but only using a simple kernel.

Sanos is open source under a BSD style license. Please see the COPYING
file for details. Sanos can be downloaded from www.jbox.dk.

 - Multitasking.
 - Single address space.
 - Kernel protection.
 - Virtual memory.
 - PE dynamically loadable modules (standard EXE/DLL format).
 - Both kernel and user modules.
 - Low memory footprint (less than 512 KB RAM)
 - Lightweight
 - Embedding support with PC104 and Flash devices
 - Self configuring (PCI, PnP & DHCP support)
 - TCP/IP networking stack with BSD socket interface
 - SMB file system support
 - Very efficient multithreading
 - Written in C (98%) and x86 assembler (2%)
