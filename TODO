    x Implement sharing flags and sopen()
    x Support for stat64(), fstat64(), tell64(), lseek64() and chsize64()
    x Change pos in struct file to off64_t

    x use tib for all static buffers to provide reentrant library
    x implement _r methods for reentrant version that does not use static buffers

- Keyboard locks up when pressing CAPSLOCK

- Return error in tcp_rexmit_seg() to signal error in retransmit (reset rtime)

- Implement ICMP messages host unreachable, net unreachable and port unreachable

- Finish implementation of NDIS subsystem

- Add support for shared interrupts to driver isr handlers

- Use bitmap for port number handling

- Multicast filtering support in network drivers

- Implement mremap() and use it in heap.c for realloc() of large blocks

- Implement krealloc() in kmalloc.c

- Handle reopening of files in smbfs after reconnect

- What happens if a file is closed while being in read() or write() on another thread?

- What happens if a tcp pcb is freed in tcp_input() while sending segments on another socket in tcp_output()?

- Scheduler enhancements
    x Change from 8 to 32 priority levels
    x Change win32 mapping to sanos priority levels
    - Remove yields in task processing and process kernel task queues at higher priority
    x Implement priority boost in mark_thread_ready()
    x Implement ready summary for thread ready queues
    x Use NT quantum units in scheduler
    x Implement dynamic and base priority for threads
    x Charge one quantum unit each time a thread is restarted after a wait
    x Preempt thread (with preempt flag) when higher priority thread gets ready to run in mark_thread_ready()
      to force context switch when thread leaves kernel
    x Implement find_ready_thread() in sched.c
    - use preempt flag instead of dispatch in set_thread_priority()
    x check for preemption when threads are resumed
    x check for preemption when new threads are created
    - add boost parameter in set_event and release_sem
    
    x 3 quantum units per tick (10 ms)
    x Timeslice is 36 quantum units
    x Priority numbers from 1 to 31 (0 is idle thread)
    x Priorities 16-31 is real time priority range
    x Priorities 1-15 is dynamic priority range
    x Boosting never moves threads to the realtime range
    x Boosting is applied to the base priority
    x Dynamic priority is decreased (decayed) at each quantum expiry until it reaches base priority 
      (in preempt_thread() if the quantum has expired)

    x In win32 priority class and relative priority are mapped to priority
      
       time critical 15 (31 if realtime)
       highest       +2
       above normal  +1
       normal         0 (idle=4,normal=8,high=13,realtime=24)
       below normal  -1
       lowest        -2
       idle           1 (16 if real time)
       
       On windows 2000 and xp the relative priority can be in the range [-7;6]

- iomux did not work with IOEVT_WRITE. This problem has been fixed.

- getsockname() returned garbage in sin_port and sin_addr. This problem has been fixed.

- getpeername() retunred garbage in sin_addr. This problem has been fixed.

*** version 1.2.6 released ***

- When a file or socket object was closed the kernel object was accessed in hfree() after being freed. 
  The file and socket objects are now freed in destroy_object() to avoid this problem.

- Handles to kernel objects was not removed from the handle table if the handle count 
  was greater than one. This problem has been fixed.
  
- Closing a socket now sends a IOEVT_CLOSE event to attached iomux. This signals a select()
  on a socket to return when one of the read sockets are being closed by the application.
  
- File was marked as modified when using futime() with dfs. This was overwriting the mtime 
  for the inode when the file was closed. Now the inode is just marked dirty.

- Floppy device was not detected unless floppy disk was inserted. This problem has been fixed
  by delaying initialization of fdc until first use.

- Added queue to loopback adapter.

- The yield() routine now discards the remaining quantum for the thread before yielding.

- Loopback packets to own address are now redirected in ether_output().

- In syscall() in kernel the error code from system calls was set in the err field in the tib. This
  overwrote the stderr handle for the thread. Now the errnum field is correctly set in the tib.

- Garbage returned by WSAGetLastError() because tib->err was mistakenly used instead of tib->errnum. This
  has been fixed.

- The value of errno is now the positive version of the error number instead of the negative.

- dup2(), creat(), sopen(), umask(), eof(), and access() added.

- File sharing, permission mode and additional open flags (O_TEMPORARY, O_SHORT_LIVED, O_DIRECT,
  O_SEQUENTIAL, O_RANDOM) implemented for smbfs.

- Temporary files added to dfs (O_TEMPORARY flag in open()).

- tell() did not correctly return the file position. It just flushed the file. This has been fixed and
  tell() now returns the file position.

- vfs and smbfs now supports large files (>2GB).

- stat64(), fstat64(), tell64(), lseek64() and chsize64() added to os interface.

- stat() and fstat() changed to conform to ANSI standard.

- Modified signal() and raise to conform to ANSI standard. Signal info can be obtained
  in signal handler by using getsiginfo(). The sendsig() function can be used to raise
  signals with context info.

- Support for 64 bit integer arithmetic. All compiler support routines for 64 bit
  integer operations implemented in libc.

- CreateFile() and SetFileTime() implemented in kernel32.

- WIN32 structured exception handling implemented in kernel32. When kernel32 is loaded it 
  takes over the global signal handler and dispatches the exceptions in the exception 
  chain in the TIB.

- MSVCRT exception handling implemented.

- setcontext() implemented.

- Added more complete ANSI Standard C Library. Many standard header files has been added to the include
  directory (conio.h, errno.h, fcntl.h, float.h, io.h, malloc.h, math.h, memory.h, process.h, share.h, signal.h,
  stddef.h, sys/types.h, unistd.h), and prototypes has been moved to their ANSI specified standard headers.

- The thread ready queues could become corrupted if a thread that was already ready was marked
  ready again. This could lead to kernel traps in the object manager because of faulty dispatching
  of threads. This problem has been fixed, by linking the threads on the ready queues in double
  linked lists and introducing new thread states. Now only threads in ready state are in the
  ready queues.

- Added job object to group threads executing an application. The CREATE_NEW_JOB flags can be used in beginthread()
  to start a new job. The spawn() function can be used to start an application in a new job.

- /dev/random and /dev/urandom devices added.

- BSD style random number functions added to lib.

- New stdio implementation with buffering, unget, and support for printf and scanf processing.

- C/C++ initializers and terminators are now processed by the crt startup/shutdown code include atexit() handlers.

- Math routines using the i387 instruction set added to standard C library (acos, asin, atan, atan2, ceil, cos,
  cosh, exp, fabs, floor, fmod, frexp, ldexp, log, log10, modf, pow, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, tanh).

- abort() now raises SIGABRT.

- div(), labs(), ldiv(), and system() added to stdlib.c.

- memccpy(), memicmp(), strset() added to string.c.

- strtod() and atof() implemented.

- asctime(), _ctime(), _strdate(), _strtime() added to time.c.

- /proc/bufstat added to buffer cache manager to show statistic for the buffer cache.

- Previously the exit() stopped the user mode code and shutdown the kernel. The exit() routine now exits the
  currently executing job. The exitos() routine now shuts down the kernel.

- Support for O_TEXT and O_BINARY flags added to vsf.c.

- connect() failed for local sockets. This problem has been fixed.

- calloc() reported out of memory if num was zero. This problem has been fixed.

*** version 1.2.7 released ***

- Garbage was outputted when printing negative numbers using printf. This problem has been fixed.

- lseek() failed with -EINVAL when seeking on a device larger than 2GB. This prevented fdisk from working on
  disks larger than 2GB. This problem has been fixed.

- The fddone flag in bootfd.c has been marked volatile to prevent optimization of interrupt wait loop.

*** version 1.2.8 released ***

- new mkfloppy utility for writing raw floppy disks.

- TCP connections are now reset before kernel shutdown or reboot.

- Serial transmitter could hang. Interrupts are now disabled when draining the transmit
  queue to prevent race condition with interrupt service routine. The transmitter is now
  started directly by the write routine. Previosly the transmitter was started by the DPC.
  The interrupt service routines now also checks for multiple interrupt indication per 
  interrupt.

- Visual Studio wizard for creating sanos application projects.

- Scheduler enhancements
    - Number of thread priorities changed from 8 to 32
    - Scheduler now uses a thread ready summary to determine next thead to run
    - Win32 thread priority mapping changed to new 32 level priority system based
      of normal priority class mapping.
    - User mode code only allowed to set priority levels 1-15
    - User mode code not allowed to change priority for kernel threads
    - Dynamic and base priority for threads implemented
    - Priority boosting implemented
    - Quantum units are now changed efter restarting waiting thread
    - Preemption when threads with higher priority than running thread implemented
 
 - TCP port numbers initialized to random range 4096-5120.

 - /proc/loadavg implemented.
